            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS is one major repository system ideal for teams of people that work together on a single file or set of files together. You can get information on what has changed from the previous version of a file, when it was changed, and you can even merge two separate changes to the same file. VCSs are in place so that many people can work on the same thing and if there are any changes, you can revert back if something isn’t right. They are important when working on things like websites, apps, or anything else technical that requires a lot of collaboration. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a place where things are stored. In the context of lesson 3 in this class, it is a storage place for multiple copies of a file. When people work on the same file together they will all make their own changes to it and all of the previous versions of the file are stored in a repository to come back to later if needed. There are two main repositories that we usually deal with: remote and local. Remote repositories are on a remote server that may be shared with many other team members working on the same file or set of files. Local repositories are on local computers for a single person. Users can save things to their own local repository and have it committed to the remote repository for everyone to see and work off of. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of a VCS. It is free and open sourced. It allows anything that you would expect from any Version Control System. You can work in it locally and then upload to a remote server. It has the ability to prevent overwriting of a file shared on the repository. There are commands you can use in order to help use and organize your files with git. They are fairly simple to use and they all start with the keyword ‘git’. A few examples are ‘git init,’ ‘git add,’ and ‘git status’. There are three basic steps to consider when using git. They are Add, Commit, and Push. This is the process to follow when making any changes to files in your repository. You add what you want, you commit it, and then you push it to the remote repository. </p>
